Common server and database Objects:
==================================

    * PostgreSQL provides many server and database objects
    * Understand each object and its usage.


Server Service:
===============

    * When we install a PostgreSQL instance, we will have a corresponding PostgreSQL server Service.
    * Also known as PostgreSQL server.
    * Different PostgreSQL servers on a single machine on different ports with different data sets.



Database:
==========

    * A database is a containter for storing other objects such as table,view,functions,indexes etc.
    * Can create any no. of databases.

Table:
======

    * Table is used to store data.
    * As many tables as you want on a database.
    * Special feature called "Table inheritance".
    * Child table can inherit from parent table.
    * Query Child table and parent table data also shows up.

Schema:
=======

    * Logical containter  of tables and other objects in a DB.
    * Each PostgreSQL DB can have multiple Schema.
    * Schema is a part of ANSI-SQL Standard.


Tablespace:
============
    * A Tablespace is where PostgreSQL stores data.
    * allows easy movement of data on physical location across drivers by using simple commands.
    Default 2 tablespaces:
        * pg_default => for storing user's data.
        * pg_global =>  for storing system data.


View:
======
    * A view is a virtual table that is able to simplify complex queries and apply security for a set of records.
    * PostgreSQL provides you with updateable views.


Function:
=========

    * A function is a reusable block of SQL code that returns a scalar value of a list of records.
    * Functions can return composite objects.

Operator:
==========
    * A symbolic Function.
    * Can create custom Operators.

Cast:
=======

    * Convert one data type into another data type.
    * Casts are usually backed by functions to perform the conversion.
    * Ovverride default casts by creating custom casts.

Sequences:
============
    * Sequences are used to manage auto increment columns that are defined in a table as as serial column.

Extension:
==========

    * Since 9.1.
    * To wrap other units such types,casts,indexes and functions into a single unit.
    * Make it easier to maintain.
